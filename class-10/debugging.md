# Debugging

The ideal: prevent bugs all together.
But we live in the real world. Errors happen.

## How can we prevent bugs

- Sudo - get target to write to. Have a plan!
- Console.log things
- proof of life, confirming information
- write small amounts of code at a time and then confirming it worked (proof of life)
- spell check
- linter
- add meaningful comment in your code

## How do we debug

- console.log
- Googling syntax
  - W3 for HTML and CSS
  - Modzilla (MDN) for JavaScript
  - Stack Overflow
- talking it out with classmates etc ...
- talking it out to myself: [Rubber Duck](https://www.mindovermachines.com/when-you-get-stuck-talk-to-the-duck/)
- walking through my code
- second set of eyes
- classmades ideas
- change of perspective, take a break, stretch, eat
- read/Google the error message
  - the line where the error occured
  - the type of error
- Git â€” commit often (ACP often)
  - comparing Git Branches
- VS undo button
